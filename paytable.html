            <h2>Payback Information</h2>
            <p>In accordance with fair gaming practices required in most legal jurisdictions worldwide, each and every game outcome is completely independent. The odds of getting any particular outcome are always the same.</p>
            <p>The odds do not vary based on prior outcomes, bet size, balance size, time of day, week, etc. For example, if the top award is won on a play, the chances of winning the top award on the next play are exactly the same.  Likewise, prior losses do not change future odds.</p>
            <p>The expected payback reflects the theoretical return across a very large number of plays by numerous players over an extended period of time.</p>
            <p>For this game, the long-term, theoretically expected payback is 97.29%.  The results for any given player over a play session can vary widely from this long-term, expected average in either direction. The fewer the number of games played, the wider the normal variance of actual payback may be experienced</p>
