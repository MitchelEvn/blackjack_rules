                <h2>Game Overview</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blackjack is a card game played using standard 52-card playing deck.</li>
                    <li>A hand is the combination of the cards dealt.</li>
                    <li>The game consists of both the Player’s hand or the Dealer’s hand.</li>
                    <li>Each card had a represented point value.</li>
                    <li>The value of a hand is determined by adding together the point value of each card within the hand.</li>
                    <li>The Player’s objective is to have a hand value that greater than the Dealer’s hand value.</li>
                    <li>If a hand exceeds 21 points, the hand “busts” and automatically loses.</li>
                    <li>A hand containing an ace and any 10-point card is called a Blackjack.  It is the highest hand and outranks any other 21-point hands.</li>
                </ul>

                <hr>

                <h2>Card Point Value</h2>
